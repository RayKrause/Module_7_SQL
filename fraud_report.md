Part One:
It is difficult to ascertain with 100% certainty if cardholders has been exposed to fraudulent activity. However, if we are basing the "potential" for fraud to be directly related to a high number of smaller transactions then we would need to conclude that more than half of the cardholders are at risk for fraudulent activity. There are a number of cardholders that have transactions under $2.00. In fact 13 cardholders have 15 or more transactions that fall into the less than $2.00 category which means they are potentially all at risk.  In order to determine if actual fraud is being perpetrated we I would need to  do a deeper dive and analyze additional data associated with these cardholders to determine fraudulent transactions.

419 out of 3500 transactions occurred between 7AM and 9AM. One in eight transactions occurred during these hours, which indicates a seems relatively average amount of transaction. If multiple transactions occurred between these hours on the same day it may raise a red flag that there is a possibility that fraud has occurred but it looks as though all 419 transactions occurred on different days. Although. seems like cardholder ID one and sixteen have multiple large transactions during the period of 7 AM and 9 AM. Both cardholders should both be contacted to verify their purchases.

What are the top 5 merchants prone to being hacked using small transactions? "Wood-Ramirez", "Baker Inc","Hood-Phillips","Walker, Deleon and Wolf","Greene-Wood".

Part Two:
It does appear that there is a large deviation in the spending habits of cardholder two and cardholder eighteen. Cardholder two has transactions that do not vary much in amount whereas cardholder eighteen has several high spikes in transactions. This may indicate that cardholder two is fiscally responsible and does not make any large purchases. Cardholder eighteen may either make larger purchases from time to time during the year or this may be an indication of possible fraudulent activity. It may be prudent to advise the cardholder regarding these purchases and verify.

After analyzing transactions for cardholder twenty-five, there are several outlier transactions in the first six months of 2018 except for February. All months had anywhere from 1-3 outlier charges. This also differs from the other months in that the third quarter is over two hundred dollars more than any other. While June is not the only month with three large purchases, the maximum purchase is five hundred dollars more than any other month. There are two transactions that look suspicious, one in January and another in March. These two transactions are both over a thousand dollars more than the upper limit for the rest of that month. It also looks like these large transactions are continuing into the second quarter and becoming more frequent, with an increase of up to three times per month, this could possibly indicate fraudulent activity.
